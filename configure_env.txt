Environment Setup on Mac.

I had to configure my python development environment from scratch since I recently reimaged my machine, so here is kind of how I did it, except there was a bit more hacking around. Feel free to set up something different though if you have a different python setup that works better for you.

1) Install Xcode (can be found via mac app store). Takes a long time to download... why do I need 11GB's?

2) Agree to Xcode license agreement in terminal. You will be asked to enter your password to run command in terminal as sudo:
sudo xcodebuild -license

3) Set up python virtual envs using these instructions. I installed mine with the --user option.

I had a few bugs, and found these posts to also be helpful

My final ~/.zshrc file looks like this:
export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3
source ~/Library/Python/3.8/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
PATH=$PATH:~/Library/Python/3.8/bin 


3) Once python virtualenvs are installed, make a virtual environment
mkvirtualenv miniproj1

4) Switch to virtualenv to run python scripts
workon miniproj1

5) I decided to set up vim as my python IDE. I put this guys example in my ~/.vimrc file.
